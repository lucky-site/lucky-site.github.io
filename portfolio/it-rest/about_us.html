          <p><i>Following <b>years of experience</b> consolidated in the industry, our major prerequisite is a high level of <b>customer satisfaction.</b></i></p>
          <h4>About us</h4>
          <p>Itrest srl was registered on 15 May 2013 in Rome, at Via dei Bastioni di Michelangelo 5/A, and in October 2020 we have opened a new working office in Terracina (Province of Latina), at Via Cecaccio, aiming not to limit the effectiveness of the team's professional strength and innovative technical knowledge to the Roman territory only, but extending it to the entire province of Latina.
          At the beginning, the commitments were limited to small-scale building renovations, today however, after years of activity and exponential growth, Itrest Ltd. is able to tackle jobs of any scale, combining efficiency, timeliness and competitiveness, thanks to the constant commitment, technical competence of the staff (construction workers, plumbers, electricians) and a high quality standard of the materials used.</p>
          <p>The company, which employs highly professional experts, including designers, architects and qualified technicians, is able to carry out any type of intervention in the construction, renovation, planned and unplanned maintenance in compliance with current regulations on accident prevention and safety at work.</p>
          <h4>Design, construction and renovation of interiors and exteriors in traditional and green buildings</h4>
          <p>Itrest srl has the means, equipment, permits and manpower to carry out works on private and industrial buildings using various construction techniques, including traditional and green methods.
          From excavation to painting, including installation of electrical, plumbing, heating and air-conditioning systems, etc., Itrest Srl looks after the building from start to finish, and makes a commitment to recruitment of personnel. This means that the entire scope of work is carried out under the supervision of one construction manager and safety coordinator who is able to manage the work in the best possible way.</p>
          <h4>Design and adaptation of systems in accordance with Law Dm 37/08</h4>
          <p>A good design/adaptation of the electrical, lighting, smart house, telematics, plumbing, thermal, air conditioning, etc. systems is the basis for the correct function of environment and technologies that are increasingly available in our homes, improving the comfort of living and domestic management. All of our systems are not only certified and warranted, but also properly designed and prepared for the application of new technologies and future extensions.</p>
          <h4>Construction Management</h4>
          <p>During the various phases of construction, the Works Manager is a key figure for interaction between the client and the site manager, capable of coordinating and mediating, in case of unforeseen circumstances that are the order of the day on the construction site, the needs of the client. "Itrest srl offers its customers the professionalism and competence of its own technicians, guaranteeing excellent results in terms of quality of execution, project reliability and adherence to deadlines. "Itrest srl is registered in the Civil Engineering Seismic Permit Management System.</p>
          <h4>Services offered by the company</h4>
          <p>A careful study of the client's needs and the potential of the property in question, combined with high qualifications of our technicians, ensure the quality of our construction and renovation services. Lighting calculations, feng shui principles, the use of wall gardens and other innovative approaches are the basis for a better development of full potential of spaces. Thanks to advanced graphic programs, the client will be able to visualize the planned areas and experience them virtually before they are built. Furthermore, the careful placement of furnishings enables comfortable living conditions to be achieved also in small spaces, making maximum use of the property's potential. We believe in sustainable use of even the smallest spaces and for this reason we are able to make customized furniture using a variety of construction techniques: plasterboard, masonry, iron, wood, etc. at a reasonable cost. We specialize in transforming uncomfortable areas into a quality space for comfortable use.</p>
          <h4>Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and servicing of condominiums and real estate units</h4>
          <p>Each building is an entire world, a vertical city on a small scale, with many different micro-realities and needs. Our task is to accompany and guide the processes of solving various problems, following the instructions and requirements of the condominium administrators.</p>
          <p>We deal with a variety of works ranging from a routine maintenance to contracts for renovation of condominium terraces, facades, finishing work, etc.</p>
